_When it comes to science-fiction roleplaying games, Traveller is granddaddy of them all, and it has it's own setting (the Third Imperium) that's been around from day one. Outside role-playing (but supported by several different games over the years) you have universes such as Star Wars, Star Trek and, more recently, The Expanse. But what other "universes" are there out there for adventuring, and what RPG systems, if any, suit their particular style of story telling._

## Dune
There’s not much I can say about Frank Herbert’s **Dune** that any well-read science fiction won’t already know. The story of the feud between the Atreides and Harkonnen which comes to a head in the year 10,198 with the ascension of Paul Atreides as the new Emperor of the Known Universe, and later his son, Leto II, as the God Emperor, is well known. The first book in particular is the subject of every existing and upcoming film, and only the 2000 & 2003 miniseries also covered Children and God Emperor (kind of).

But there is an Expanded Universe for Dune, written by Brian Herbert and Kevin J Anderson, which covers over 30,000 years of human history aside from the 30 or so years in the original books.

### The Machine Crusade & Butlerian Jihad (BG)
Before the New Empire ruled by the Padishah Emperors of House Corrino there was an Old Empire which saw the initial expansion of the human race beyond the Sol system using relatively slow FTL technology. This empire existed for an unknown period of time before the **Time of the Titans** when a group of cyborg-enhanced humans took control of the known universe.

### God Emperor, the Golden Path and The Scattering

## Hyperion Cantos
The **Hyperion Cantos** is a series of science fiction novels by Dan Simmons. The name comes from the first pair of books in the series, **Hyperion** and **The Fall of Hyperion**, later supplemented by **Endymion**, **The Rise of Endymion**, and a number of short stories set in the same universe. The first two books are set on the planet **Hyperion**, the home of the Time Tombs (mysterious monuments which appear to be travelling backwards in time) and their guardian, the cyborg killing machine called **The Shrike**.

Old Earth was destroyed long ago by the **Big Mistake**, the creation of a black hole which slowly consumed the Earth, with mankind evacuating during the **Hegira** to colonize other worlds and form the **Hegemony of Man**. 

The Hegemony is a socio-political society of over 150 billion humans across more than 200 worlds, ruled by a legislature consisting of the **All Thing** (a consensus-based public forum accessible to all members of the Hegemony via neural implants), the **Senate**, and a Senate CEO who fills the executive role. Communication is in real-time across the entire Hegemony, thanks to **Fatline Transponders** and the **WorldWeb**, and travel between worlds uses a network of **Farcaster Portals** which join two points in spacetime together - Farcasters can be of almost any size, from those that allow trains or even rivers to move between worlds to those no bigger than a doorway that allow single buildings to be spread out across the entire Hegemony. Starships can be used, but carry a relativistic “time debt” when they are.

Fatlines and Farcasters are made possible by **The Void Which Binds**, more commonly known as Planck Space - an invisible and intangible domain which permeates the known universe; as its name suggests, it is the plane which unifies all existence, unlimited by space and time. While its precise nature is poorly understood, it is used by various entities in the universe for travel, communication and even habitation. 

A major player in the Hegemony is the **TechnoCore**, a conglomerate of Artificial Intelligences that have achieved self-sentience and act as an organization, society and race allied with Humans. There are also the **Ousters**; groups of latter-day Humans who have colonized the fringes of known space, adapting through extreme genetic modification to the point where they are barely considered human any more.

The first two books takes place on the planet Hyperion; which, like the books, may be the subject of a pilgrimage by the Player Characters but little detail of other worlds is covered.
