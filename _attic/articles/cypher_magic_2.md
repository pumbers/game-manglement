_In the [first article in this series]({{< relref "cypher_magic_1.md" >}}), I outlined an Elemental Meta-Magic system which could be mapped on to the Cypher System rules from Monte Cook Games. In this article, I will describe (in game terms) the **Elemental Adept Type** - an adaptation of the Adept Type from the core rulebook._

## Elemental Adept

You master powers or abilities outside the experience, understanding, and sometimes belief of others. These powers and abilities come from the world around you, pulled from the very elemental essence of creation and channelled for effect by you.

**Individual Role:** Adepts are usually thoughtful, intelligent types. They often think carefully before acting and rely heavily on their supernatural abilities. 

**Group Role:** Control of elemental forces takes time and practice to master, but an Adept can often surprise, both in and out of combat, by thinking outside the box. At higher tiers they control the very forces of nature and can accomplish feats beyond imagining.

**Societal Role:**In settings where the supernatural is rare, strange, or feared, adepts are likely rare and feared as well. They remain hidden, shadowy figures. When this is not the case, adepts are more likely to be common and forthright. They might even take leadership roles. 

**Advanced Adepts**: Even at low tiers, adept powers are impressive. Higher-tier adepts can accomplish amazing deeds that can reshape the environment around them. 

**Background Connection:**Your type helps determine the connection you have to
the setting. Roll a d20 or choose from the following list to determine a specific fact about your background that provides a connection to the rest of the world. You can also create your own fact. 

### Adept Stat Pools

An Elemental Adept starts play at First Tier with the following stat pools:

| Might | Speed | Intellect |
|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 7 | 9 | 12 |

You get 6 additional points to divide among your stat Pools however you wish.
