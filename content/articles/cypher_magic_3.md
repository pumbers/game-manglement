_In the [first article in this series]({{< relref "cypher_magic_1.md" >}}), I outlined an Elemental Meta-Magic system which could be mapped on to the Cypher System rules from Monte Cook Games. In the [second article]({{< relref "cypher_magic_2.md" >}}) I layed out the **Elemental Adept Type**, and in this article I will look at a **Magic Flavor** that can be applied to other character types to allow them direct access to elemental magic._
