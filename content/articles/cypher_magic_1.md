My love of the Cypher System has been a rocky road (as in rough, not the ice cream). Back when I first laid hands on a copy of Numenera (1st edition), I read it and didn't understand it. I loved the background and storylines - and bear in mind here I've been playing role-playing games since Classic Traveller at University in England. I still didn't get the game system. My gut told me it worked and it was very good, but my head didn't get it. So I put it on one side for a while.

Then when the Cypher System Rulebook came out, I grabbed a copy. I read it, loved it, but still didn't get it. Or rather I understood the basics but I didn't see how Cyphers could be at all versatile enough to be used in so many different ways across so many different game worlds.

One of the things I disliked (intensely) about Cypher - and still do to this day - is the randomness and capriciousness with which magic is spread across the types and foci. The Adept class and Magic Flavor seemed to be a hodgepodge of magical abilities with no real pattern or order to them. The same goes for some non-magical abilities, but I can live with those because there's not so many of them.

Why should I be able to __Erase Memories__ or do __Hedge Magic__ at First-Tier? How come I can't create barriers until Third-Tier? Why do I have to wait until Sixth-Tier to cause earthquakes? How is erasing memories related to creating earthquakes. It didn't make sense.

I wanted to create a magic system for Cypher which (i) fits with the game mechanics of cyphers and artifacts, (ii) had some sort of order and reasoning behind it so that players could create their own magical effects from the building blocks provided and (iii) allowed characters at any tier to create potentially significant effects if they wanted to risk it.

I puzzled over it for some time. I hate spell lists, they take forever to write (and besides, most are nth generation copies of OSR spell lists anyway). I hate [Vancian Magic](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/VancianMagic), just the idea of forgetting a spell once it's cast seems very **Discworld** to me (or is it the other way around).

And then I happened upon the [Classical Elements Expansion](https://github.com/Honno/classical-elements-expansion) by Matthew Barber (aka Honno, a University student living in my old hometown of Birmingham, UK).

I liked it, so I contacted Matt and got his permission to use the idea in an RPG.

It had the same elements (pun intended) as classical elemental magic - *Earth*, *Air*, *Fire* and *Water* referred to as *first-order* or *Fundamental* elements - but then (as the name suggests) it expanded on the available elements by mixing these fundamentals into *second-order Terrestrial* elements and adding *third-order Celestial* elements. The *fourth-order* elements are usually referred to as *Origin* and are the source of all magic. In game terms, magic can have any origin - I'm not telling you what mine is because that would just ruin it for the players and isn't really important yet.

NOW I had more than the basic four elements to play with and could start to produce some serious meta-magic. Here we go. Not much Cypher System stuff yet, just the basics of the magic system.

## Magic 101

Magic is elemental in nature. Everything that was, is and will be is built from combinations of the fourteen elements on the chart. The material world is composed of the *fundamental* and *terrestrial* elements while the immaterial world, the world we cannot see but is the structure on which consciousness is built, is composed of the *celestial* elements.

Most of what you see around you contains so little pure elemental form that it is considered *mundane*. A stream is just water, a campfire is just fire and earth is just dirt. But, every now and then those skilled in the ways of magic, those who have *affinity* with particular elements can find a concentration, a *node* or *nexus* of pure element.

### Using Nexi

Once a nexus has been found, the pure elemental form can be either *chanelled* or *bound*. An adept can tap into the nexus and channel the energies from it immediately and directly. Think: find a fire nexus, stick your hand in it, throw a fireball, the nexus is gone (along with whatever you threw the fireball at). This tends to be risky and uncontrolled with potentially bad side-effects - such as a burned hand or other form of fatigue or damage - but is direct and effective.

The alternative is to *bind* the nexus, either to a suitable inanimate object or to a person.

*Binding* to an object requires something which, in elemental terms, has a relationship or affinity for the element being bound. A small glass vial, for example, can be used to bind a water or air nexus. A tinderbox can hold a fire nexus. A wood nexus can be attached to an existing object, say the hilt of a sword or a staff.

When the nexus is bound, the Adept has a choice: they can either bind the *raw nexus* or create an *expression*.

Binding the raw nexus does just that - the elemental nexus is bound and can be tapped into at any point in the future to create a magical effect **BUT** this can only be done by an Adept who has *affinity* for the element. Adepts without affinity for that element can sense it's power, but do nothing with it. To anyone else, it's just a dumb old object.

Creating an *expression* binds the nexus to the object AND fashions it into a pattern for creating a specific effect which can later be called forth by **anyone** who knows the trigger the Adept imprinted at the time of binding. Triggers can be anything the Adept desires: trigger words, somatic gestures, the presence of other elements or objects. Your choice. Take a fire nexus, bind it to a charcoal rod and imprint it with a codeword or phrase - now you have a wand of fireballs (in Cypher terms, single use only).

A nexus can also be bound to a person or other living being and the binding can be either raw or expressed.

Needless to say, binding a raw elemental nexus to a living being is risky for both parties (but particularly the recipient). A raw elemental nexus is like an unexploded bomb being held in check only by the recipient's Intellect. If the recipient is ever knocked unconscious or dies, the nexus is released in a chaotic fashion (GMs fiat) - sleep is OK though as the subconscious keeps the nexus in check. If the recipient is an Adept: congratulations - you now have a raw elemental nexus on tap whenever you need it. Handy. If the recipient is not an Adept: congratulations, any Adepts around you have access to a raw elemental nexus whenever they need it (even if you don't want them to).

How about binding to a living being that is NOT considered sentient (0 Intellect, effectively)? Can't happen. There must be some form of sentience or consciousness sufficient to receive and contain the nexus and most animnals (for example) don't have that. The binding will simply fail with the nexus being released (perhaps catastrophically) in the process.

When a nexus is bound to a person and expressed, as with an inanimate object, the Adept can decide on the (Cypher) effect and trigger. This nexus can then *ONLY* be triggered by the recipient and will not trigger accidentally if the recipient is knocked unconscious or dies (unless that was the trigger). Much, much safer.

The effect that a nexus produces is primarily related to the nature of the nexus - Freeze tends to produce some form of intense cold effect - and will never produce an effect related to its opposing element on the chart. You can't get a Magma nexus to produce ice, for example. A nexus also has a secondary effect related to its *Transcendental State*. Spark, for example, has the state *Kinetic* so could be used to produce a "Haste" or rapid movement effect (increasing the kinetic energy of an object or person) or even the exact opposite, causing someone or something to grind to a halt (decreasing the kinetic energy). 

Finally, whenever an Adept uses a nexus (either when it is found or from a binding), they can choose to **combine** that nexus with others to create new nexi. For example, let's say an Adept has a Fire nexus and Air nexus bound to himself. He can choose to manifest them and combine them (according to the chart) to produce a Steam nexus which has the transcendental state *Ascend* - hey, a levitation spell.

### Limitations

The world is both shaped by and shapes magic. The latter is how you find elemental nexi, and they're almost only ever found in small numbers. The former is how magic creates its own limits - having too much magic in one place creates unwanted side effects. Any time there is more than one elemental nexus bound to a single person or that person is carrying more than one bound object, there may be a problem. What keeps the magic in check is willpower or intellect.

The act of consciously carrying one or more bound nexi is sufficient to keep them in check, at least up to a limit of a handful per person. In game terms, this is where the cypher limit comes from. Carry too many cyphers and a GM intrusion may result in an unintended, catastrophic side effect being generated by one or more of those cyphers. GM fiat again.

If you're carrying a bound nexus in your body, there are also the physical changes. Any elemental nexus bound to a living being will cause some sort of physical change, called a *mark*, which the recipient has some control over at the time of binding. Most often, these are made to appear as tattoos or sigils on the skin which cannot be erased until the nexus is used - they can be in a place obscured by clothing or hair. Sometimes, they can manifest as physiological changes: hair color, eye color, skin color, a different texture or appearance to the skin and so on.

Anyone carrying a bound nexus can, at any time, simply release the nexus from its binding. All this takes is a few seconds conscious thought **BUT** they will have almost no control over how the nexus behaves when it is released. That pesky GM fiat again. Releasing an air nexus might result in a sudden strong gust of wind which blows everyone around, a fire nexus might cause a blast of intense heat, and so on.

## Summary

So, now I have the basis of an elemental magic system which is flexible - almost any effect can be created - and is not tied to random abilities at given tiers. It works with the game system - cyphers, cypher limits, artifacts, etc and it has the opportunity to create a wide variety of in-game effects as intrusions of one form or another.

Future articles will cover how this can be implemented within the Cypher System, including Adept Type and Magic Flavor implementations.
