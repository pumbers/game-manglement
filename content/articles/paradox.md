_A few years ago, I had a dream. I left the home I shared with my wife, Lorraine, for some reason - probably to go to work. When I came back, the house wasn’t there. The houses to either side of ours were there, but ours just wasn’t, and nor was my wife. Nobody in the area knew me or remembered either of us, but other friends and family did and they maintained that I’d never been married and lived somewhere else. It was a really weird and, frankly, terrifying dream and it stuck with me._

Since then, for no connected reason I’ve taken to watching physics lectures on YouTube - particularly relating to the wonderful world of Quantum Field Theory and the like. Some of those concepts have connected in my brain to that earlier dream and formed the basis of an RPG setting.

## What Is Happening?

Your characters are normal people, maybe even yourselves, until one day something happens that you can’t explain. A part of your life changes. Something you **KNOW** to be true is no longer true, and you’re the only one that knows it.

Perhaps, like me, a big part of your life disappears. A wife, husband, children, friends, your home, your job - something changes. Maybe it’s something small that you barely notice at first: a store where you shop occasionally disappears without trace, there's a new building along the drive into work in the morning but you don't recall seeing it being built. As far as everyone else is concerned, what you remember never happened. The world was never that way.

Your first problem is: how do you cope with this? If you no longer have a home, a spouse, friends, a job. Survival will come first. Then you need to figure out what’s happening - are you going mad, or is **THIS** somehow for real.

While you’re trying to figure things out, a stranger comes up to you in a public place and hands you a book. They say: _“When you can read it, come find me”_, and they leave before you can stop them. The book can be anything: a simple notebook, a leather bound volume, a Filofax, but it will always be a physical book and not an eBook reader. Inside the book are pages and pages of weird symbols.

They mean nothing to you. They make no sense. But you keep going back to the book and trying to make something of it and then, one day, part of it does. You start to see patterns. Meaning. The book tells of a history you don’t remember. A history that never happened - except it did. A different President of the United States, different wars, companies you don't know, people you’ve never heard of. And there are other things you do know, but related to events you don’t recall. This is an alternate history of the world, and it makes sense.

But there’s more. As you read the book, you start to see something else. An alternate history **OF THE FUTURE**. The book details people, places and events that haven’t happened yet and it shows you how they will happen. It lays out patterns of causality that show how **YOU** can influence events, for better or worse.

## What Is Happening?

You don’t know it. Yet. But you are now an unwitting and/or unwilling soldier in a war for the future.

A long time from now, perhaps even at the end of time, there are factions at war. Each of them faces survival or annihilation, and it all depends on their own history. On how history played itself out in the past and how much they can change history to their benefit.

## The Physics of It

We know the normal flow of causality: the past creates the future. One event leads to another, and another, and another until the future becomes the now. The [double-slit experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-slit_experiment) proves that the universe is not [deterministic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Determinism) - it is not an algorithm or machine simply playing out what it is programmed to do. Free will does exist. Changing the now changes the future and **YOU** have a choice about what you do.

What few know is that the future can also change the past - without time travel or paradoxes.

Here’s how.

The universe , all of time and space is not three dimensional. In fact, the universe is a [four-dimensional quasicrystal projection of an eight-dimensional platonic solid called E8](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_(mathematics)>). E8 is a perfect arrangement of eight-dimensional tetrahedra of [Planck Size](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_length). Projecting E8 down to three dimensions and rotating it gives us every elementary particle in the physics playbook. Projecting it into four dimensions adds what we call “time”. [^1]

Consciousness exists outside of E8 and is the manner by which we (conscious beings) perceive E8 as four-dimensional - the three-dimensional world plus time.

It is possible for conscious beings (us… and others) to change E8. By acting in four dimensions, we can change specific parts of E8, and since E8 encompasses all of (what we perceive as) space and time, we can change (literally) any place or time through our actions.

**There is no time travel.** We, as conscious individual beings, do not ever travel to the past or the future. We always act in the now, but the now we know can (and will, if we make it) change around us. We will recall the history we knew and perceive the new world around us when it changes. By changing the present with conscious free will we are changing the structure of E8, not only in the present but, if done correctly, in both the past and the future.

There are no paradoxes. The past we recall actually did happen, that’s why we remember it. We remember it because we are conscious, sentient beings and (if you recall) consciousness exists outside E8. We do not recall the new now because we did not live through it. Our past has changed and we ‘re the only ones that know it because we are the only ones who were aware of a change being made.

## How Does This Work?

The book you now have is an instruction manual. It comes to you from one of the factions in the far future. You don’t know which one. It shows you actions you can take in the now that will effect changes in the past and create a new present and a new future. It’s up to you which actions you take and which changes you create. Oh, and it changes as well - the events and actions detailed are, by virtue of the fact they exist in the three-dimensional universe, influenced by changes in E8.

> For example: you note in the book that there is a war coming, a big one. Somehow, there is a chain of events which culminates in that war that can be changed by making sure that a young girl, a secretary at an accounting firm in New York, gets to work late on a day a few weeks from now. Your choice.

More to the point, who or what is going to try to stop you? If one faction wants the war averted then the odds are good that another will want to war to happen. Suddenly, making that girl late may not be so easy. Or maybe there is something you **NEED** to do but you choose not to. Who will appear to make you take that action?

## Factions

First and foremost, there are the shadowy factions at the end of time that are behind the whole conflict. You have no idea who they are and probably never will. They may be human, but equally, they may not.

You will always be coming into conflict with other soldiers in the war - other people from your own time who have also become pawns in the game and will be fighting either alongside you or against you.

Then there are the “neutral” factions. There will always be a government agency of some sort that have learned of the war and are either trying to stop it, advance it or at the very least blend it to their own ends.
