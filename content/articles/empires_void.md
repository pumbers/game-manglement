_When it comes to science-fiction roleplaying games, Traveller is granddaddy of them all, and it has it's own setting (the Third Imperium) that's been around from day one. Outside role-playing (but supported by several different games over the years) you have universes such as Star Wars, Star Trek and, more recently, The Expanse. But what other "universes" are there out there for adventuring, what kinds of stories might they inspire, and what RPG systems suit their particular style of story telling._

## Overview[^1]

What was formerly believed to be a supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way is revealed to be an artificial construct, known as the Void. Inside, there is a strange universe where the laws of physics are very different from those we know, and it is slowly consuming the other stars of the galactic core until one day it will have devoured the entire galaxy.
