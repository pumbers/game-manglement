**Condition:** In general, I take very good care of my games & books, and like to keep them in good condition. Titles that have been played are more likely to have the spine broken-in and possibly some minor scuffs. If I say it's in _very good condition_ that means it's not _mint_ but all the pages are intact and in place, and the book has no obvious scuffs or scrapes.

**Puchasing:** [PM me on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/paul.umbers) if you're interested in purchasing. I have no fixed idea of prices, so just make me an offer. I'm more likely to accept a low offer if you're interested in **all** of the items as a job-lot rather than just one or two. Payment can be made by PayPal, and the item shipped when the funds clear; I'll send you a picture of the shipping receipt to confirm they've been sent. If you want photographic confirmation that I **do actually** have the items before you pay, I can do that as well.

**Postage:** I live in Alberta, Canada, so postage within Canada is not too bad but postage to the USA and the rest of the world can be ridiculously high, particularly for heavy items like books. If you're interested in some items, I'll weigh and size them, and look up then **possible** cost using Canada Post in Canada; for USA/international shipping I would probably use FedEx. I'll let you know the cost of shipping & packaging before we agree on a price.

**Finally**, please bear with me if any of the above steps take a few days. I'll try to ship as quickly as possible, but I also have a job that I need to work at that takes up a lot of my time, so it may take a few days for me to get things together. Please be patient.
