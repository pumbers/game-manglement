_There are any number of tools out there for putting together random dungeons, or a wilderness area, or maps, or monster lists,and so on. But I thought this time out I'd talk a little about the tools I use for game prep and online play._

# Finding the Right Time and Place

Online games have the unique feature that almost anyone from anywhere in the world can join in, which is a great way to get to know people from other countries and cultures but a **huge** nightmare when it comes to coordinating games across multiple timezones. Enter [Time and Date's Meeting Planner](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html). Enter a whole bunch of cities and/or timezones, select a rough date & time around the world and you'll get a handy calendar that shows when various times in those cities coincide and whether they're considered normal work, play or sleeping hours.

# Mood Art

Even when I play **theatre of the mind** games, I like to have some artwork on hand to help add atmosphere and give the players something visual to go along with my descriptions (which, I'll admit are not perfect sometimes). They also help provide details that I can enhance with descriptions. Obviously, search tools like Google or Duck-Duck-Go are great for finding images to use, but sometimes they're not quite what you want, and if you're not handy with Photoshop or the like they may not be exactly what you need.
