_It is 710 AD. It is an age of iron and ruin, a wolf-season amid the ashes of Roman Britain. The spears of the English tribes are raised against their rivals, and the Wealh of the western hills remember bitterly what was taken from them. The shattered caesters of past Roman glory litter the land, each one laden with forgotten troves hidden by desperate men of the last days. Sorcerous Arxes once sealed against a Roman rescue that never came are now cracking open, the changed refugees within now seeking vengeance for a ruin of centuries past. The holy minsters of pious monks and godly nuns stand as bulwarks against cruel and merciless bloodshed, but can their labors ever hope to tame the beasts within their kinsmen's hearts?_

So the opening blurb for **[Wolves of God: Adventures in Dark Ages England](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/308470/Wolves-of-God-Adventures-in-Dark-Ages-England)**, the latest role-playing game from the prolific Kevin Crawford and Sine Nomine Publishing, goes.

Over the years I've played more fantasy RPGs than I can remember, and recently found the standard _Tolkienesque_ fantasy style somewhat same-old and boring. I have, however, acquired two new tastes: weird fantasy (Ã  la [Into the Odd](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/145536/Into-the-Odd), [Electric Bastionland](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/308100/Electric-Bastionland), [Ultraviolet Grasslands](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/302021/Ultraviolet-Grasslands-and-the-Black-City), [Magical Industrial Revolution](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/291774/Magical-Industrial-Revolution), etc) and Dark Ages fantasy. The former because it contains less predictability and more chance of something new, surprising and fun; the latter sparked by TV series such as [Vikings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2306299/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1) and [The Last Kingdom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4179452/).

So, why is Dark Ages fantasy so different and appealing?

* It's a low-magic setting; magic is rare, dangerous and difficult. As WoG points out, you won't see a _Galdorman_ (mage) throwing fireballs around the battlefield, their role more likely revolves around knowledge of the arcane and sorcerous, performing rituals, perhaps some healing but also dealing with people by helping them out. 
* While there is much in the way of ritual, protocol and ???, there are little in the way of material trappings. The things that make a late-chivalric period knight stand out - the armor, weapons and horses - either don't exist or are reduced to the basics. Perhaps strangely, this actually makes all these things more important. If a warrior has a fine weapon or armor, they're special to him (or her) and not immediately replaceable. In fact, Wog has the concept of **Splendors** where the "bling" a character wears actually has an in-game effect - combat re-rolls.
