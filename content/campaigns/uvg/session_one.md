_This first session of Ultraviolet Grasslands using Cypher System started off well enough, after a few weeks of planning and a Session Zero that built the characters, but fell flat when the GM (me) was hit by a power cut and lost all network connectivity other than Discord on my cellphone. But hey, these things are sent to make us stronger._

## Our Heroes

**Aberama Gold** is a Violet City doghead inquisitor. He came to the Violet City some time ago by ship from across the Circle Sea and now works for the noble cats of the Violet Citadel (he knows the cats are the real lords). He wields the power of the Purple Goddess and hunts for doghead insurrectionists in and around the city. Aberama has spent some time out in the Purple Land of the Cat hunting his quarry, but he's recently heard portents of a deadly machine demon who might be able to overthrow his masters. He's gathering a crew to head out into the grasslands to investigate, but also to see if he can make some cash.

**Leo** is an adept, new to the Violet City, having come here to find new magicks for his master. He's heard about caravans to the Grasslands and is interested in joining one to further his quest.

**Pascal** is a lyrical accountant, a number cruncher who specializes in creating poetic ledgers that embody subjective beauty and emotional truth as well as being numerically accurate. His life is driven by his abacus, which somehow shows a new number at the start of every day, a number which often dictates or at least provides the basis for Pascal's actions that day.

**Woosh** is a plant-man (or man-plant, depending on your own genus). Known to varying degrees throughout the city, he appears harmless as he wanders the parks and boulevards, fertilizing trees and bushes while carrying his Sunshine Gem. When spoken to, he responds rarely and softly with a voice that sounds like a breeze blowing through leaves. None in the city have ever seen anything like him before, but does that make him unique?


## The Story Begins

Afternoon in the **Violet City** is a complicated affair. Like cities of the **Before Times**, the Violet City never sleeps, but its level of wakefulness does change as the day rolls by, in particular when the purple haze of the cocktail hour arrives. The sounds and smells of the city seem somehow more restrained, and the tendencies of some folks lean towards contemplation, siesta and coffee.

It is at this time we find our Heroes (capital H), gathering in **The Under-Dog Cafe** in the Charger's Ward of the city. Sure, the city is ruled by the ever-present **Cat Lords**, but that doesn't mean there isn't room for the odd, illicit establishment serving Dog Coffee instead of the ubiquitous Cat Coffee. In this case, the Under-Dog is in this modest commercial district, not far from the **Marut**, an ancient stone colossus of unweathered stone, where local merchants come to make contracts (it is said that anyone who breaks an oath sworn upon the Marut will be slain before the next dawn. Probably not true, but then who would dare find out the hard way).

Outside, as the shadow of **The Shrine of Georguy** (a stone niche enshrining the holy symbol of Georguy, Lord of Protection, said to reveal visions to those who leave an offering) falls across the basement windows of the cafe, our heroes are deep in conversation...
