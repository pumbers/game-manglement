_While I don't normally indulge in fantasy campaigns, my watching TV shows such as [The Last Kingdom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4179452), [Vikings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2306299) and [Knightfall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555364) has prompted me to put together a dirty, low-magic, gothic horror background._
