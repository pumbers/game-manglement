### Background

In addition to any background hints derived from the character descriptor, type, focus or abilities, the GM should work with the Player to decide where the Adept lies in Worlds society. It's likely they will have been apprenticed to a master or affiliated with a guild or chapter at some point early in their career. Those contacts may be available to the character or even directing their actions, or the character may now be freelancing and acting counter to guild lore. Their implants will have come from somewhere and may require regular maintenance or upgrades; contacts there would be appropriate.
