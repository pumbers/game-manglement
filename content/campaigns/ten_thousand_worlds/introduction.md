_Towards the end of 2018, Steve Jackson Games delivered on their [Kickstarter for The Fantasy Trip](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sjgames/the-fantasy-trip-old-school-roleplaying). The rules were cleaned up, expanded, prettified and reboxed, and they turned out **nice**. So, while I don't normally indulge in fantasy campaigns, my watching TV shows such as [The Last Kingdom](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4179452/), [Vikings](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2306299) and [Knightfall](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4555364/) has prompted me to put together a dirty, gothic horror background for TFT. Welcome to **The Greydawn Reaches**_
