_The Ten Thousand Worlds (work-in-progress) is an adaptation of David Black’s (in)famous [Black Hack RPG (2nd Edition)](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/255088/The-Black-Hack-Second-Edition) to a futuristic science fantasy setting. A copy of the Black Hack 2e is required for the basic rules but available character classes and details of ships & equipment will be included along with a detailed background to adventure in._

_If you want to get a feel for life in the 10K, think Firefly, a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy, some Doctor Who and a fair bit of The Expanse._

## Introduction

Somewhere, in some star system light years away and a long time ago, Earth died.

The Human Race, knowing the end was coming, migrated en masse to a new home. This home. We inherited a ruined system, full of ancient derelict habitats, hollowed-out asteroids and the remnants of planets that had long been used up as construction material. Other races have made their home here over millennia, all now as dead as the worlds they once settled. But they left behind remnants of their lives for us to explore, and sometimes profit from.

Old worlds were colonized. New worlds created: utopias, dystopias, empires, alliances and more. And there are still mysteries out there: ancient megastructures, derelict ships and stations left over from enumerable wars, and troves full of treasure long forgotten.

All you have to do is survive it.

Welcome to the ***Ten Thousand Worlds***.

## The 7818 Lacertae System

On Old Earth, the 10K would have been known as ***7818 Lacertae***. Theories hold that once, millions of years ago, it contained 11 planetary bodies but now has only one, the others having been reduced to rubble by some cataclysmic stellar event ... or maybe just engineering on a planetary scale.

The system is a trinary (three stars) with the two main stars, ***Clotho*** and ***Lachesis***, a close binary pair, and a distant companion, ***Atropos***.

The orbital mechanics of the binary pair, while complicated, actually result in a simple layout for the system – especially with virtually no planets around to muck things up.

The binaries have five gravitationally stable points – called ***Lagrange Points*** – numbered L1 through L5. Points L2 through L5 are mostly free of hazards (other than free-floating asteroids), and this is where the bulk of the colonies are located.  The L1 point, located directly between the binary pair, is a region of intense radition and superheated gas clouds which is even more inhospitable to life than empty space. That’s not to say there are no colonies here though, they’re just really, really well built.
Between L4 and L5 and across L1 is a “quiet zone” in the gas and radiation which allows relatively safe passge between those two points – an area called the ***Berangu Passage***.

Finally, the pair are surrounded by a series of asteroid belts which are home to thousands of mining and exploration colonies.

The far companion, Atropos, also has a series of asteroid belts and mining colonies and is orbited by the system’s one remaining planet, the gas giant: ***Hela***. Aside from being somewhat of an anomaly by being the lone planet in the system, Hela is the system’s major source of hydrogen fuel for ships. Gas mining platforms orbit high in the atmosphere with their syphons dropping hundreds of kilometers into the gas-rich lower layers. Transport ships, carrying supercooled super-compressed hydrogen make regular trips between the two parts of the system.

## Powers & Factions

Life in the 10K is hard, no doubt about it, and is not necessarily made any easier by the roller-coaster of tensions between the three main power-bases:

### The Dynasties

The most overt power in the 10K is held by the descendants of the captains and crew of the great colony ships. Arriving in the 10K, they naturally assumed positions of leadership in and over the established colonies. After a time, they became rich, powerful and paranoid – trusting few outside their own lineage and handing power down only to their descendants.

Centuries of conflict and intrigue has left very few of the major houses intact along with a scattering of minor houses, all of whom form and break alliance after alliance and wage both covert and overt war on each other.

Despite this, they remain the greatest example of visible power. Some, like the Vogary and Braecia, occupy ancient construct worlds of immense size from which they have extracted technology that gives them a distinct edge. Others maintain their power through a scattering of colonies and alliances with the Monger Clans and the Guilds.

None are to be completely trusted.

### The Monger Clans

From the outset, free trade between newly established colonies was critical. What one colony did not have could destroy them when they could easily be saved by what another colony produced.

Initially, trade was controlled and protected by the Dynasties and the colonies themselves but as life spread throughout the 10K centralised control became difficult and inefficient. So, the Monger Clans evolved. These “lesser” families and alliances focused only on trade, never owning or managing any colonies but simply on the movement of trade goods – and money – throughout the system.

Like the street gangs of old Earth, they established their “territories” – both physical and commercial – with conflict arising generally only when they stepped outside established boundaries.

The Monger Clans either control, oversee or are aware of most of the ships, travel and trade throughout the 10K. While this rarely brings them to blows with the Guilds (who they rely on for much of the work force), disagreements with the Dynasties are quite common but usually resolved in a way that ensures trade continues unabated.

### The Guilds

Both the Dynasties and the Monger Clans, while they established their power bases, were beholden in large part to the workers they used to build and fly their ships, grow their food, refine their fuel, make their equipment and even fight for them.

For a long time, these workers had no organisation or form of management beyond their noble or corporate masters. That is until the Retaliation of the Tainted, which saw a massive worker uprising and period of prolonged guerilla warfare. Eventually, with the treaty of the True King the workers banded together and began to form what is now the Guilds.

So, while it is still possible to find a few independants for specific jobs, for the most part if you want to get your ship repaired or find a pilot, you talk to the Spacers guild. If you want to keep a colony running, you hire workers from the Engineers or Agris. Medics will come from the Guild of Asclepius, and so on.

Out on the rim, anything goes but in-system hiring non-guild workers in Guild territory is not such a good idea.
