_Cybernetics in the 10K are pretty common, usually used to replace damaged or missing limbs or other organs. Technadepts, however, take the use of cybernetics and implanted technologies to the next level. Technadept implants are always far more advanced than anything freely available, sometimes even alien in origin, and they have used this to build an air of mysticism around what they are capable of, referring to the effects they create as “spells” or “incantations”._

> We are dreamers, shapers, singers, and makers. We study the mysteries of laser and circuit, crystal and scanner, holographic demons and invocation of equations. These are the tools we employ, and we know many things. The true secrets, the important things. Fourteen words to make someone fall in love with you forever. Seven words to make them go without pain. How to say good-bye to a friend who is dying. How to be poor. How to be rich. How to rediscover dreams when the world has stolen them.

## Cypher System

### Character Type

The *Cypher System* **Adept** character type can be used unchanged from the core rulebook, with the caveat that innate abilities attributed to "magic" must have some form of advanced technology behind them. For example, **Hedge Magic** can be attributed to any number of minor, low-power implants which create holograms or use magnetic force to levitate objects. **Onslaught** is almost certainly a weapon implant of some sort and **Scan** refers to a number of enhanced sensory implants linked to an AI analysis unit connected to the central nervous system.

When a Player chooses an ability for their character, the GM should have them specify *how* the effects are created and roughly what form of technology is involved.

Stat pools and starting attributes are as described in the *Cypher System Core Rulebook*.

### Character Descriptor

Any Character Descriptor for Cypher System can be applied to Technadepts in the 10K.

### Character Focus

Any Character Focus can be used *if the Player can come up with a suitable explanation for how the effects are generated*, however the following focuses are particularly applicable to Technadepts in the 10K:

| **CYPHER SYSTEM RULEBOOK**|||
|:--|:--|:--|
Battles Robots|Builds Robots|Calculates the Incalculable
Commands Mental Powers|Conducts Weird Science|Doesn’t Do Much
Entertains|Fights Dirty|Fights with Panache
Focuses Mind Over Matter|Fuses Flesh and Steel |Fuses Mind and Machine
Infiltrates|Interprets the Law |Is Idolized by Millions

|**EXPANDED WORLDS**|||
Conducts Rocket Science|Hacks Networks|Loves the Void
Negotiates Matters of Life and Death|Resides in Silicon|Serves in an Elite Military Squad
Transcends Humanity|Works for a Living	

### Cyphers

Cyphers and Artifacts in the 10K take the same form as in **Numenera**, they are advanced technology akin to magic. Whether Cyphers are man-made and just highly advanced or relics of previous alien occupations of the 10K is up to the GM. Repairing and building Cyphers is possible, just use the crafting rules from Numenera and particularly from **Numenera Destiny** where new Cyphers can be constructed from *Iota* - the scrap left behind by alien civilisations.

## The Black Hack

### Starting Stats

***Starting HP:*** roll 1D4

***Starting HD:*** 1d4

***Usable Weapons & Armour:*** Light or Medium weapons, Light armour

***Attack Damage:*** 1d4 or 1 if unarmed
Arcane Fortune

If you roll a 1 for starting Hit Points – you may choose an additional spell from Level 3 or 4.

### Sufficiently Advanced

A Technadept may spend an Action on their Turn to “cast” any one of their available “spells”. Once the effects are resolved, the Technadept must make an ***Attribute Test*** – adding the spell’s level to the roll. If they have already used the spell this session the test is made with ***Disadvantage***. If they fail, the spell implant is temporarily overloaded or disabled, and they must rest to restore its functionality.

### Technalysis

When you inspect or appraise an item to find out what it does, how it works or what it might be worth, Roll an ***Intelligence Test*** with ***Advantage***.

### Equipment

Every Technadept starts with 1d4+2 “spells” of your choosing from level 1 or 2. They will also start the game with a ***Control Device*** such as an amulet, staff, wand or other artifact with 1D4Ud. When they use this device to direct or control a spell any ***Attribute Test*** is made with ***Advantage***.

### When you gain a new level

Acquire and share a number of Experiences equal to your current HD to advance a Level. When you gain a Level:

* Roll a d20 once for each Attribute - if you roll over, it goes up one point, make an extra roll for either Intelligence or Wisdom. 
* Gain 1HD - Roll 1d4 - gain that many additional maximum HP. 
* Upgrade the Ud for your control device by one step
