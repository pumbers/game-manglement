_Soon after the **Influx**, the Captains of the great colony ships and the first stations established themselves as absolute rulers of their domains. Power was passed down through their family lines and those of their subordinates, and over the centuries they built great trading empires, fleets and Worlds._

Hundreds of families formed the Great and Lesser Houses of these **Dynasties**, with their reach and influence appearing supreme. They felt they had the right and privilege to do anything, to anyone.

They were wrong.

The common uprising saw the destruction of almost all the Dynasties, the **Braecia Dynasty** being the largest survivor. The **Treaty Of The Highborn** saw the end of the fighting and a peace, of sorts, between the Worlds. The Dynasties command respect and wield considerable influence but are a shadow of their former selves... for now.  

>"For a thousand years, my family ruled these Worlds. Our fleets were supreme in their might and nothing was beyond our reach. We kept peace with the other Dynasties, we protected what was ours and when necessary we crushed our enemies with ease. We fell, not from power but from grace and we carry the weight of the Worlds. One day we will rule again." - Dynast Corva Miros ne Dyemour of the Braecia Dynasty

Centuries of conflict and intrigue has left few of the major houses intact along with a multitude of minor houses, all of whom form and break alliance after alliance and wage both covert and overt war on each other. Despite this, they remain the greatest example of visible power. Some, like the **Vogary** and the **Braecia**, occupy ancient construct worlds of immense size from which they have extracted technology that gives them a distinct edge. Others maintain their power through a scattering of colonies and alliances with the Monger Clans and the Guilds.

None are to be trusted.

### Character Type

Since being a Dynast is more about background than profession, almost any character type from the core rulebook can be used. **Warriors** may be the warlords or generals leading their fleets and armies against other dynasties, or knights protecting their family's territory; **Explorers** and **Adepts** are likely to be outcasts as their inclinations tend to take them beyond known space or outside of polite society, but they will still have their family's interests in mind.

If you want to add a degree of mysticism, dynastic **Adepts** can be treated like shaman, seers or sages, working schemes and machinations in the background, using their peculiar abilities to build their power base far from view.

The most appropriate type for a Dynast is the Speaker, where the emphasis is on leadership, intrigue and political machinations. The *Cypher System* **Speaker** character type can be used unchanged from the core rulebook

Stat pools and starting attributes are as described in the *Cypher System Rulebook (Revised)*.

### Background

In addition to any background hints derived from the character descriptor, type, focus or abilities, the GM should work with the Player to decide where the Dynast lies in society. They may be a member of one of the great houses, such as Braecia or Vogary (although their access to overwhelming power and technology should be limited), or they may be a member of one of the minor houses constantly vying for support from their peers and rivals.
