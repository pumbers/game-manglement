_The Ten Thousand Worlds is a (work-in-progress) futuristic science fantasy setting. If you want to get a feel for life in the Worlds, think Firefly, a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy, some Doctor Who and Farscape and a fair bit of The Expanse._

## Concept

## Build

### Type

The following Character Types are suitable for play in the Ten Thousand Worlds, but if you have a good character concept then don’t be limited by this list. They’re just suggestions.

Role|Cypher System Type
:---|:---
Heavy|Warrior
Tech|Explorer with technology flavor
Pilot|Explorer with technology flavor
Dynast|Speaker
Medic|Speaker with skills and knowledge flavor
Monger|Speaker with technology or skills and knowledge flavor 
Operative|Explorer with stealth flavor
Technadept|Adept
Seeker|Explorer

Roles, background connections and other details can generally be taken as listed in the Cypher System Rulebook but should always be considered in the context of game history and background. Technadepts, for example, have powers and abilities which appear “magical” in nature, but which are derived from advanced (sometimes alien) technology and cybernetic implants. GMs should encourage (and even require) Players to write these explanations in their background notes.
