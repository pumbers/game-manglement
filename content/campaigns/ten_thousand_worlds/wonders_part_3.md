_There are many mysteries, wonders and dangers in the **Ten Thousand Worlds**, some of them are worth a lot of money to those brave enough to investigate them. Most of them will kill you stone dead._

_Welcome to the Ten Thousand Worlds._

## Berangu Passage

Located across the L1 zone between the L4 and L5 points, the Berangu Passage is a gravitationally clear area of space where the radiation and superheated gases from the Clothos & Lachesis binary are at their least dangerous and, as a result, the area is more navigable.

Although narrow by the standards of open space, the passage is hundreds of thousands of kilometres wide. Somewhere near the L1 point is Solnos, the home of the Black Moon Confederacy.

## Solnos

Solnos is home to the **Black Moon Confederacy**, a loose alliance of scavengers and miners operating in and around the Berangu passage. It's remote nature and the difficult conditions in the L1 region make it virtually impossible for the Dynasties or other factions to police the area, and so Solnos and surrounding colonies have become a haven for those enjoying a more "socially free" lifestyle - ie: pirates & smugglers.

## Phenom

Phenom is a relic from a distant previous age: a [Bishop Ring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bishop_Ring_(habitat)); essentially, a small Ringworld. Because of its enormous scale, Phenom does not need to be enclosed like a Stanford torus: it is built without a "roof", with the atmosphere retained by artificial (spin) gravity and atmosphere retention walls some 200 km (120 mi) in height. The habitat is oriented with its axis of rotation perpendicular to the plane of its orbit, with an arrangement of mirrors to reflect sunlight onto the inner rim and an artificial light source in the middle, powered by a combination of solar panels on the outer rim and solar power satellites.

The habitat is approximately 1,000 km (620 mi) in radius and 500 km (310 mi) in width, containing 3 million square kilometers (1.2 million square miles) of living space, comparable to the area of Argentina or India on Old Earth.
