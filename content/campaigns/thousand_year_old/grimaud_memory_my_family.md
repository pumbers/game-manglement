<!-- Prompt #3 -->
7. <span id="7"></span>Aelis, my sister, hears that I have returned and finds me at Mainet's a few days later. I tell her of my curse, and instead of fearing or rejecting me she gives me her gold crucifix to wear hoping it will calm the darkness within me, and although I can scarcely bear to touch it I take it from her.  [&#8594;](#8 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #1/2 -->
8. <span id="8"></span>As Aelis tends to me in the forest late one evening, my thirst grows unbearable; her crucifix burns me to my soul as I touch it. I throw it at her in anger; she screams and runs for the manor and the safety of home. Before I know it, the hunt has overtaken me and I can no longer control myself. By morning, I know Aelis no longer lives... but I fear instead of death my curse has now become hers as well. [&#8594;](#9 "Next Experience")
