#### Memory: Always Leaving

<!-- Character Creation -->
4. <span id="4"></span>My father tells me that I must redouble my training, and be prepared to take Renier's place in service at Autelbas. Although this may be years away and it is my duty to do so, I do not relish the thought of leaving my home in service to another. I leave home anyway, on my own terms, to find my own destiny.

<!-- Prompt #18 -->
14. <span id="14"></span>I must leave this place before I am found again. Traveling in a horse train is something they will not expect, but I have few options. On the edge of town one night, I come across a trader with his mules, likely bound to join a train in the morning. If I feed now, the hunters will know I was here, so I make his murder look like the attack of a wolf pack. His mules, clothing and meagre possessions I add to my own, and for now I am concealed.

15. <span id="15"></span>The hunters are persistent, they anticipated I may try to conceal myself in daylight and were checking all travelers passing on the road, and they had the help of a priest throwing his bedamned holy water at each man as he passed. Although they were few and I was able to slaughter them quickly and escape, my hand was badly burned by the rank liquid - I fear it will never heal. I make it to moorlands to the north, where life rarely ventures and there is precious little to feed on, but I feel safe for now. In this wilderness I contemplate my actions, and think of myself now as as Grimaud le Perdu, for I am truly lost. [&#8594;](#16 "Next Experience")
