_After hearing and reading so much about it, I decided to dive in and try out [Thousand Year Old Vampire](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/) by Tim Hutchings. In this first session, I'll document initial character creation and responses to the first few prompts from the book. I have it in my head that I'd like to play a young Frankish knight from the Dark Age reign of Charlemagne, so I dig out my copy of [Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/234701/PALADIN-Warriors-of-Charlemagne) by Ruben in â€™t Groen because not only is it a great historical RPG but it also provides a lot of the detail for the initial period that I'll need._

I'll record my vampire's experiences as a journal, updated in each session. If you want to follow his journey, read the experiences in numerical order; [click here](#1) to start then follow the [&#8594;](#1 "Next Experience") at the end of each paragraph.

## Destiny is what we seek; fate is what we endure along the way.

#### Characters
- ~~Guillaume de Fremay, my father (mortal); stern but fair, a hunter and knight, loyal to his lord.~~

- Brielle, the dark lady, the witch who cursed me to this never ending torment (immortal).
- Drogo du Loup, hunter (mortal)

#### Resources
- ~~The manor at Fremay, in the Ardennes. Built by my Grandfather on land gifted by Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of the King, Thierry IV.~~
- My sword, plain but well made; it will serve me for many years until I pass it on to my son as his first sword.
- My brother Renier's bible (diary); he brought it with him and gave to me as he lay on his deathbed. I treasure it as my last memory of him. Inscribed in the margins are favorite memories of my family... and reminders of their deaths.
- Aelis' crucifix necklace, given to me by her after Mainet's murder.
- Woolen Cloak

#### Marks
- Tattoos permanently mark most of my body, etched there by the she-devil witch I know only as Lady Brielle. They can never be removed.
- Severe burn marks on the left hand, from being splashed with Holy Water. The wound irritates and angers me, but will not fully heal.

## Analysis and Thoughts

### Session One

This first session took about 90 minutes and didn't involve much referencing of the TYOV book; the rules are pretty straightforward. The majority of the time was spent reading up on Frankish Knights, names, places, etc and was pretty interesting in itself. As I wrote the character's experiences I started to really like the character and the way he was developing; he's certainly a tragic figure. Even though I'm writing the experiences, it feels as though the character is telling his own story and I have no idea what will come next.
