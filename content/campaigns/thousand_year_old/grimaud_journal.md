_After hearing and reading so much about it, I decided to dive in and try out [Thousand Year Old Vampire](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/) by Tim Hutchings. I have it in my head that I'd like to play a young Frankish knight from the Dark Age reign of Charlemagne, so I dig out my copy of [Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/234701/PALADIN-Warriors-of-Charlemagne) by Ruben in â€™t Groen because not only is it a great historical RPG but it also provides a lot of the detail for the initial period that I'll need._

I'll record my vampire's experiences in this journal, updated after each session. If you want to follow his journey, read the experiences in numerical order; [click here](#1) to start then follow the [&#8594;](#1 "Next Experience") at the end of each paragraph. [^1]

## Destiny is what we seek, fate is what overtakes us on the way.

#### Characters

- ~~Guillaume de Fremay, my father (mortal); stern but fair, a hunter and knight, loyal to his lord.~~
- Aelis, my younger sister (mortal... later immortal enemy); fair and kind, with an impish sense of humor.
- ~~Mainet, my childhood friend (mortal); we explored the forests around my home together, and my father allowed him to hunt with us on occasion.~~
- Brielle, the dark lady, the witch who cursed me to this never ending torment (immortal).
- Drogo du Loup, a trapper & hunter (mortal).
- Gauthier, a small child who I befriend, him thinking me a "water spirit" of the moors (mortal).

#### Resources

- ~~The manor at Fremay, in the Ardennes. Built by my Grandfather on land gifted by Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of the King, Thierry IV.~~
- My sword, plain but well made; it will serve me for many years until I pass it on to my son as his first sword.
- My brother Renier's bible (diary); he brought it with him and gave to me as he lay on his deathbed. I treasure it as my last memory of him. Inscribed in the margins are favorite memories of my family... and reminders of their deaths.

#### Marks

- Tattoos permanently mark most of my body, etched there by the she-devil witch I know only as Lady Brielle. They can never be removed.
- Severe burn marks on my left hand, from being splashed with Holy Water. The wound irritates and angers me, but will not fully heal.

## Analysis and Thoughts

### Session One

This first session took about 90 minutes and didn't involve much referencing of the TYOV book; the rules are pretty straightforward. The majority of the time was spent reading up on Frankish Knights, names, places, etc and was pretty interesting in itself. As I wrote the character's experiences I started to really like the character and the way he was developing; he's certainly a tragic figure. Even though I'm writing the experiences, it feels as though the character is telling his own story and I have no idea what will come next.

### Session Two

I was initially stumped by a prompt that talked about me taking advantage of a change in goods transport, simply because in the 8-9th centuries nothing much happened in that regard. My research showed only that horse trains of 50+ became more commonplace around that time, so I ran with it as best I could. I'm still not sure about the whole chase & escape thing either, as I came across several prompts in a row which forced me to write about being hunted and escaping to somewhere new all the time. It was certainly harder to think of something to write, but I guess that's the nature of the game and I'm reasonably happy with the outcome.

[^1]: In case you're wondering, here's a quick rundown of the TYOV rules. The vampire's undead life consists of a series of **Experiences** which are short paragraphs written in response to a series of randomly generated writing prompts. Experiences are kept in **Memories**, of which the vampire can have up to five at any time. Memories can be moved to **Diaries** at any time, but while Memories remain, Diaries can be lost. Along the way, the vampire encounters **Characters** who may be friends, enemies, mortals or immortals. They accumulate **Resources** which may be carried with them or fixed and immovable, either of which may be lost over time. They can learn, use and lose skills that may help (or even hinder) them over the centuries, and lastly they acquire indelible **Marks** which hint at the unearthly nature of the vampire.
