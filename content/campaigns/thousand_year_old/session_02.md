_After hearing and reading so much about it, I decided to dive in and try out [Thousand Year Old Vampire](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/) by Tim Hutchings. In this first session, I'll document initial character creation and responses to the first few prompts from the book. I have it in my head that I'd like to play a young Frankish knight from the Dark Age reign of Charlemagne, so I dig out my copy of [Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/234701/PALADIN-Warriors-of-Charlemagne) by Ruben in â€™t Groen because not only is it a great historical RPG but it also provides a lot of the detail for the initial period that I'll need._

I'm recording my vampire's experiences as a journal, updated in each session. If you want to follow his journey, read the experiences in numerical order; [click here](#1) to start then follow the &#8594; at the end of each paragraph.

## Journal of Grimaud de Fremay

**Destiny is what we seek; fate is what we endure along the way.**

#### Characters
- ~~Guillaume de Fremay, my father (mortal); stern but fair, a hunter and knight, loyal to his lord.~~
- Aelis, my younger sister (mortal... later immortal enemy); fair and kind, with a distinct sense of humor.
- ~~Mainet, my childhood friend (mortal); we explored the forests around my home together, and my father allowed him to hunt with us on occasion.~~
- Brielle, the dark lady, the witch who cursed me to this never ending torment (immortal).
- Drogo du Loup, hunter (mortal)
- Gauthier, a small child who I befriend, him thinking me a "water spirit" of the moors (mortal)

#### Skills
- [ ] Play Musical Instrument
- [X] Hunt
- [X] Battle
- [X] Bloodthirsty
- [ ] ~~Ashamed~~
- [X] Wilderness Survival

#### Resources
- ~~The manor at Fremay, in the Ardennes. Built by my Grandfather on land gifted by Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of the King, Thierry IV.~~
- My sword, plain but well made; it will serve me for many years until I pass it on to my son as his first sword.
- My brother Renier's bible (diary); he brought it with him and gave to me as he lay on his deathbed. I treasure it as my last memory of him. Inscribed in the margins are favorite memories of my family... and reminders of their deaths.
- Aelis' crucifix necklace, given to me by her after Mainet's murder.
- Woolen Cloak

#### Marks
- Tattoos permanently mark most of my body, etched there by the she-devil witch I know only as Lady Brielle. They can never be removed.
- Severe burn marks on the left hand, from being splashed with Holy Water. The wound irritates and angers me, but will not fully heal.

### Memories

#### Memory: My Father
<!-- Character Creation -->
1. <span id="1"></span>I am Grimaud, son of Guillaume de Fremay, vassal knight to our lord Duke Thierry of Ardennes in the year of God 767 AD. For my youth, I would hunt with my father in the forests around our manor at Fremay, until one day a very different fate overcame me. [&#8594;](#2 "Next Experience")

<!-- Character Creation -->
2. <span id="2"></span>My father, on my eighteenth birthday, gives me the gift of my first sword. I have trained with many, but this one is mine and I will one day pass it on to my son, as my father's sword will be mine when he passes. [&#8594;](#3 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #5 -->
9. <span id="9"></span>With Aelis turned, I visit my father to confess my sins and beg his forgiveness. He has lost my brother Renier, myself, and now thanks to me, Aelis as well. He rages at how I have taken everything, his life and line, from him. My curse must be undone and I must be cleansed; he sends a servant for Father Fromond... but before the man can leave, I kill them both. Whatever I am now, I cannot be exposed. [&#8594;](#10 "Next Experience")

#### Memory: The Wilderness

<!-- Prompt #11 -->
10. <span id="10"></span>Taking what few belongings I have, I lose myself in the forest where I slake my hunger for fresh blood on the animals there. I write of my family, and their fates, in the margins of Renier's bible finding solace in reliving my time with them and relieving me of some of my shame. [&#8594;](#11 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #21 -->
16. <span id="16"></span>Out here on the moors there is little cover and concealment, but for some time now I have discovered I can take shelter from the daylight in the marshes and bogs; as with the lake, it is not a pleasant experience but it works well enough and I have no idea who might still be hunting me, so I endure. I am found, at dusk one day, by a young boy. His face is not one of fear though, but uncharacteristically one of delight. He thinks me a esprit de l'eau - a water spirit, and although my hunger calls to me he reminds me of Mainet at the same age and I cannot find it in my unbeating heart to feed on him. Little Gauthier lives, for now. [&#8594;](#17 "Next Experience")

#### Memory: Always Leaving

<!-- Character Creation -->
4. <span id="4"></span>My father tells me that I must redouble my training, and be prepared to take Renier's place in service at Autelbas. Although this may be years away and it is my duty to do so, I do not relish the thought of leaving my home in service to another. I leave home anyway, on my own terms, to find my own destiny. [&#8594;](#5 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #18 -->
14. <span id="14"></span>I must leave this place before I am found again. Traveling in a horse train is something they will not expect, but I have few options. On the edge of town one night, I come across a trader with his mules, likely bound to join a train in the morning. If I feed now, the hunters will know I was here, so I make his murder look like the attack of a wolf pack. His mules, clothing and meagre possessions I add to my own, and for now I am concealed. [&#8594;](#15 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #16/2 -->
15. <span id="15"></span>The hunters are persistent, they anticipated I may try to conceal myself in daylight and were checking all travelers passing on the road, and they had the help of a priest throwing his bedamned holy water at each man as he passed. Although they were few and I was able to slaughter them quickly and escape, my hand was badly burned by the rank liquid - I fear it will never heal. I make it to moorlands to the north, where life rarely ventures and there is precious little to feed on, but I feel safe for now. In this wilderness I contemplate my actions, and think of myself now as as Grimaud le Perdu, for I am truly lost. [&#8594;](#16 "Next Experience")

#### Memory: Of Becoming Undead

<!-- Character Creation -->
5. <span id="5"></span>In my wandering, I come across the Black Man, the silhouette of a man without a heart carved out in the granite rock just south of Christnach, and meet Lady Brielle there. She enchants me, and I find myself in her company more often than not; until one morning I awake to find myself branded with devil's marks. I feel I am no longer human, but I know not what I am. Brielle tells me she will find me, when the time is right. [&#8594;](#6 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #1 -->
6. <span id="6"></span>Confused, I return to my home at Fremay. I cannot seek counsel from my father after leaving so suddenly and against his will, so I go to see Mainet but he rejects me as ungodly and cursed. In my rage at his rejection, I draw my sword and cut him down. As he lies on the floor, bleeding to death, I feel only a dark thirst from within... [&#8594;](#7 "Next Experience")

#### Memory: Chase and Escape

<!-- Prompt #20 -->
11. <span id="11"></span>The forest has been my home for more years than I can count, the animals and people of Fremay and nearby villages my prey for that time, and although I have tried to be careful the rumors of the "Branded Man" are growing. Lone travelers are too easily spotted, but horse trains have become commonplace for goods transport and I can use that to my advantage. As long as I stay covered and can hold my hunger for a time, I can travel with one of these without suspicion for a new life far from here. Soon. [&#8594;](#12 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #18 -->
12. <span id="12"></span>They have found me! I was careless; I could not contain my hunger and in a frenzy fed on a single family in one night, groups of villagers search the forest for the "Branded Man" and I must leave. Now. I take a chance and stop at the manor, my old home, now in ruins. I find my father's favorite cloak, bedraggled and worn with time but useful as concealment, so I take it... as a memory. His sword is nowhere to be found.[&#8594;](#13 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #18 -->
12. <span id="13"></span>I should not have stopped at the manor. A hunting party, well armed and with dogs, have caught my scent. I recognize their leader, a man known as Drogo du Loup - the Wolf. I have seen him many times in the forest, even learned some hunting and survival skills by observing him. But now he hunts me! I take to the rivers and streams to conceal my scent but they come too close when I find a lake blocking my path so I decide to hide under the water. My curse will not let me die, but the experience of rank water entering my body is not pleasant.[&#8594;](#14 "Next Experience")

<!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

### Diary - Renier's Bible

#### Memory: My Family

<!-- Character Creation -->
3. <span id="3"></span>My elder brother, Renier, returns from his service at Autelbas for a brief visit. He goes hunting with my father, but his horse falls and he receives grievous injuries which take him from us a few days later. My father is inconsolable. [&#8594;](#4 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #3 -->
7. <span id="7"></span>Aelis, my sister, hears that I have returned and finds me at Mainet's a few days later. I tell her of my curse, and instead of fearing or rejecting me she gives me her gold crucifix to wear hoping it will calm the darkness within me, and although I can scarcely bear to touch it I take it from her.  [&#8594;](#8 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #1/2 -->
8. <span id="8"></span>As Aelis tends to me in the forest late one evening, my thirst grows unbearable; her crucifix burns me to my soul as I touch it. I throw it at her in anger; she screams and runs for the manor and the safety of home. Before I know it, the hunt has overtaken me and I can no longer control myself. By morning, I know Aelis no longer lives... but I fear instead of death my curse has now become hers as well. [&#8594;](#9 "Next Experience")
