#### Memory: Chase and Escape

<!-- Prompt #20 -->
11. <span id="11"></span>The forest has been my home for more years than I can count, the animals and people of Fremay and nearby villages my prey for that time, and although I have tried to be careful the rumors of the "Branded Man" are growing. Lone travelers are too easily spotted, but horse trains have become commonplace for goods transport and I can use that to my advantage. As long as I stay covered and can hold my hunger for a time, I can travel with one of these without suspicion for a new life far from here. Soon. [&#8594;](#12 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #18 -->
12. <span id="12"></span>They have found me! I was careless; I could not contain my hunger and in a frenzy fed on a single family in one night, groups of villagers search the forest for the "Branded Man" and I must leave. Now. I take a chance and stop at the manor, my old home, now in ruins. I find my father's favorite cloak, bedraggled and worn with time but useful as concealment, so I take it... as a memory. His sword is nowhere to be found. [&#8594;](#13 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #18 -->
13. <span id="13"></span>I should not have stopped at the manor. A hunting party, well armed and with dogs, have caught my scent. I recognize their leader, a man known as Drogo du Loup - the Wolf. I have seen him many times in the forest, even learned some hunting and survival skills by observing him. But now he hunts me! I take to the rivers and streams to conceal my scent but they come too close when I find a lake blocking my path so I decide to hide under the water. My curse will not let me die, but the experience of rank water entering my body is not pleasant.[&#8594;](#14 "Next Experience")
