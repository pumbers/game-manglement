_After hearing and reading so much about it, I decided to dive in and try out [Thousand Year Old Vampire](https://thousandyearoldvampire.com/) by Tim Hutchings. In this first session, I'll document initial character creation and responses to the first few prompts from the book. I have it in my head that I'd like to play a young Frankish knight from the Dark Age reign of Charlemagne, so I dig out my copy of [Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/234701/PALADIN-Warriors-of-Charlemagne) by Ruben in â€™t Groen because not only is it a great historical RPG but it also provides a lot of the detail for the initial period that I'll need._

I'll record my vampire's experience as a journal, updated in each session. If you want to follow his journey, read the experiences in numerical order.

## Journal of Grimaud de Fremay

**Destiny is what we seek; fate is what we endure along the way.**

#### Characters
- ~~Guillaume de Fremay, my father (mortal); stern but fair, a hunter and knight, loyal to his lord.~~
- Aelis, my younger sister (mortal... later immortal enemy); fair and kind, with a distinct sense of humor.
- ~~Mainet, my childhood friend (mortal); we explored the forests around my home together, and my father allowed him to hunt with us on occasion.~~
- Brielle, the dark lady, the witch who cursed me to this never ending torment (immortal).

#### Skills
- [ ] Play Musical Instrument
- [ ] Hunt
- [ ] Battle
- [X] Bloodthirsty
- [ ] ~~Ashamed~~

#### Resources
- The manor at Fremay, in the Ardennes. Built by my Grandfather on land gifted by Charles Martel, the Mayor of the Palace of the King, Thierry IV.
- My sword, plain but well made; it will serve me for many years until I pass it on to my son as his first sword.
- My brother Renier's bible (diary); he brought it with him and gave to me as he lay on his deathbed. I treasure it as my last memory of him. Inscribed in the margins are favorite memories of my family... and reminders of their deaths.
- Aelis' crucifix necklace, given to me by her after Mainet's murder.

#### Marks
- Tattoos permanently mark most of my body, etched there by the she-devil witch I know only as Lady Brielle. They can never be removed.

### Memories

#### Memory
<!-- Character Creation -->
1. I am Grimaud, son of Guillaume de Fremay, vassal knight to our lord Duke Thierry of Ardennes in the year of God 767 AD. For my youth, I would hunt with my father in the forests around our manor at Fremay, until one day a very different fate overcame me.

<!-- Prompt #5 -->
9. With Aelis turned, I visit my father to confess my sins and beg his forgiveness. He has lost my brother Renier, myself, and now thanks to me, Aelis as well. He rages at how I have taken everything, his life and line, from him. My curse must be undone and I must be cleansed; he sends a servant for Father Fromond... but before he man can leave, I kill them both. Whatever I am now, I cannot be exposed.

#### Memory

<!-- Character Creation -->
2. My father, on my eighteenth birthday, gives me the gift of my first sword. I have trained with many, but this one is mine and I will one day pass it on to my son, as my father's sword will be mine when he passes.

<!-- Prompt #11 -->
10. Taking what few belongings I have, I lose myself in the forest where I slake my hunger for fresh blood on the animals there. I write of my family, and their fates, in the margins of Renier's bible finding solace in reliving my time with them and relieving me of some of my shame.

#### Memory

<!-- Character Creation -->
4. My father tells me that I must redouble my training, and be prepared to take Renier's place in service at Autelbas. Although this may be years away and it is my duty to do so, I do not relish the thought of leaving my home in service to another. I leave home anyway, on my own terms, to find my own destiny.

#### Memory

<!-- Character Creation -->
5. In my wandering, I come across the Black Man, the silhouette of a man without a heart carved out in the granite rock just south of Christnach, and meet Lady Brielle there. She enchants me, and I find myself in her company more often than not; until one morning I awake to find myself branded with devil's marks. I feel I am no longer human, but I know not what I am. Brielle tells me she will find me, when the time is right.

<!-- Prompt #1 -->
6. Confused, I return to my home at Fremay. I cannot seek counsel from my father after leaving so suddenly and against his will, so I go to see Mainet but he rejects me as ungodly and cursed. In my rage at his rejection, I draw my sword and cut him down. As he lies on the floor, bleeding to death, I feel only a dark thirst from within...

### Diary - Renier's Bible

#### Memory

<!-- Character Creation -->
3. My elder brother, Renier, returns from his service at Autelbas for a brief visit. He goes hunting with my father, but his horse falls and he receives grievous injuries which take him from us a few days later. My father is inconsolable.

<!-- Prompt #3 -->
7. Aelis, my sister, hears that I have returned and finds me at Mainet's a few days later. I tell her of my curse, and instead of fearing or rejecting me she gives me her gold crucifix to wear, hoping it will calm the darkness within me, and although I can scarcely bear to touch it I take it from her.

<!-- Prompt #1/2 -->
8. As Aelis tends to me in the forest late one evening, my thirst grows unbearable; her crucifix burns me to my soul as I touch it. I throw it at her in anger; she screams and runs for the manor and the safety of home. Before I know it, the hunt has overtaken me and I can no longer control myself. By morning, I know Aelis no longer lives... but I fear instead of death my curse has now become hers as well.

## Analysis and Thoughts

This first session took about 90 minutes and didn't involve much referencing of the TYOV book; the rules are pretty straightforward. The majority of the time was spent reading up on Frankish Knights, names, places, etc and was pretty interesting in itself. As I wrote the character's experiences I started to really like the character and the way he was developing; he's certainly a tragic figure.

Even though I'm writing the experiences, it feels as though the character is telling his own story and I have no idea what will come next.
