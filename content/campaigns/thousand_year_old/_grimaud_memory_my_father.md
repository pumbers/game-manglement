2. <span id="2"></span>My father, on my eighteenth birthday, gives me the gift of my first sword. I have trained with many, but this one is mine and I will one day pass it on to my son, as my father's sword will be mine when he passes. [&#8594;](#3 "Next Experience")

<!-- Prompt #5 -->
9. <span id="9"></span>With Aelis turned, I visit my father to confess my sins and beg his forgiveness. He has lost my brother Renier, myself, and now thanks to me, Aelis as well. He rages at how I have taken everything, his life and bloodline, from him, how my curse must be undone and I must be cleansed. He sends a servant for Father Fromond... but before the man can leave, I kill them both. Whatever I am now, I cannot be exposed. [&#8594;](#10 "Next Experience")
