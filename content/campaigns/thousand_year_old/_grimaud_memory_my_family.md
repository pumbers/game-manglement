<!-- Prompt #3 -->
7. <span id="7"></span>Aelis, my sister, hears that I have returned and finds me at Mainet's a few days later. I tell her of my curse but instead of fleeing in terror at my appearance she gives me her gold crucifix to wear hoping it will calm the darkness within me, and although I can scarcely bear to touch it I take it from her.

<!-- Prompt #1/2 -->
8. <span id="8"></span>As Aelis tends to me in the forest late one evening, my thirst grows unbearable; her crucifix burns me to my soul each time I touch it. I throw it at her in anger; she screams and runs for the manor and the safety of home. Before I know it, the hunt is upon me and I can no longer control myself. By morning, I know Aelis no longer lives, though her corpse is nowhere to be found. I fear instead of death my curse has now become hers as well. [&#8594;](#9 "Next Experience")
