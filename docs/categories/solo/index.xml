      <description>After hearing and reading so much about it, I decided to dive in and try out Thousand Year Old Vampire by Tim Hutchings. In this first session, I&#39;ll document initial character creation and responses to the first few prompts from the book. I have it in my head that I&#39;d like to play a young Frankish knight from the Dark Age reign of Charlemagne, so I dig out my copy of Paladin: Warriors of Charlemagne by Ruben in â€™t Groen because not only is it a great historical RPG but it also provides a lot of the detail for the initial period that I&#39;ll need.</description>
