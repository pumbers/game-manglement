      <description>In recent years, we&#39;ve seen a lot of early RPGs, such as Traveller and Runequest, resurrected in new editions with cleaner rules and more modern presentation which, for the most part, have retained the original feel of the game. Chivalry &amp;amp; Sorcery has seen several editions over the years, the last almost 20 years ago in 2000 (not counting the 2011 &amp;ldquo;Essence&amp;rdquo; release which was only 44 pages). Now, following a successful Kickstarter, a new 5th Edition has returned at a whopping 602 pages.</description>

      <description>Brass is a board game set in Lancashire, England during the Industrial Revolution, developed by Martin Wallace and originally released in 2007. The object is to use cards and cash to build mines, cotton factories, ports, canals and rail links, and establish trade routes, all of which will be used to victory score points. This review covers the newly-released Lancashire and Birmingham editions from the 2017 Kickstarter campaign by Roxley Games.</description>
