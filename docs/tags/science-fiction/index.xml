      <description>OK, this started as some fun with me messing with my friends heads in a series of Facebook posts while I was rewatching the original Star Wars trilogy, but it grew so out of hand I thought I&amp;rsquo;d expand on it here. To mess with your head.
The Premise It&amp;rsquo;s simple: Star Wars didn&amp;rsquo;t really happen the way it did in the movies. Sure, there was an evil galactic empire that overthrew a good-natured republic and killed off a whole bunch of space-wizards in the process, but that was in the prequel trilogy and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go there because while they&amp;rsquo;re kinda watchable movies they&amp;rsquo;re also pretty bad as far as the details and canon consistency are concerned, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to focus on the original trilogy: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.</description>
