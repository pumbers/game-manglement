      <description>The Ten Thousand Worlds (work-in-progress) is an adaptation of David Blackâ€™s (in)famous Black Hack RPG (2nd Edition) to a futuristic science fantasy setting. A copy of the Black Hack 2e is required for the basic rules but available character classes and details of ships &amp;amp; equipment will be included along with a detailed background to adventure in.
