      <description>My love of the Cypher System has been a rocky road (as in rough, not the ice cream). Back when I first laid hands on a copy of Numenera (1st edition), I read it and didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. I loved the background and storylines - and bear in mind here I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing role-playing games since Classic Traveller at University in England. I still didn&amp;rsquo;t get the game system. My gut told me it worked and it was very good, but my head didn&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description>
