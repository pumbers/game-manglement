      <description>Late last year (2018) I took the plunge and ordered up a 3D printer to help me with my tabletop gaming (and a few other things). I&amp;rsquo;d had my eye on one for some time, but they always seemed way too expensive (in excess of $1,000 CAD) and I was unwilling to commit such an amount when I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure of the benefits. Two things changed my mind: firstly, I did a lot of research into what could and could not be achieved with a sub-$1,000 printer, and secondly the Creality Ender 3 Pro hit the market.</description>
