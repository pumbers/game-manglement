      <description>There are many mysteries, wonders and dangers in the Ten Thousand Worlds, some of them are worth a lot of money to those brave enough to investigate them. Most of them will kill you stone dead.
Welcome to the Ten Thousand Worlds.
The Testament of Cycles The Testament of Cycles is, looking at at it simplistically, a book - but quite unlike any other book in existence. Firstly, it is not a physical object (although physical copies of parts of it have been made).</description>

      <title>The Ten Thousand Worlds: Technadepts</title>

      <description>Cybernetics in the 10K are pretty common, usually used to replace damaged or missing limbs or other organs. Technadepts, however, take the use of cybernetics and implanted technologies to the next level. Technadept implants are always far more advanced than anything freely available, sometimes even alien in origin, and they have used this to build an air of mysticism around what they are capable of, referring to the effects they create as “spells” or “incantations”.</description>

      <description>The Ten Thousand Worlds (work-in-progress) is an adaptation of David Black’s (in)famous Black Hack RPG (2nd Edition) to a futuristic science fantasy setting. A copy of the Black Hack 2e is required for the basic rules but available character classes and details of ships &amp;amp; equipment will be included along with a detailed background to adventure in.
If you want to get a feel for life in the 10K, think Firefly, a bit of Guardians of the Galaxy, some Doctor Who and a fair bit of The Expanse.</description>

      <title>Star Trek Adventures: Fighters</title>

      <description>The Command Division sourcebook for Star Trek Adventures includes, almost hidden away in the Federation Small Craft chapter, the details of the Federation Attack Fighter, also called the Zabathu1 class (after an Andorian riding animal). This is really the first reference in the rules made to any sort of fighter class ship and, to be sure, such craft are rarely seen in Star Trek itself. Most ship battles on screen are between two or more capital ships which make up the vast majority of any faction’s fleet.</description>

      <description>Brass is a board game set in Lancashire, England during the Industrial Revolution, developed by Martin Wallace and originally released in 2007. The object is to use cards and cash to build mines, cotton factories, ports, canals and rail links, and establish trade routes, all of which will be used to victory score points. This review covers the newly-released Lancashire and Birmingham editions from the 2017 Kickstarter campaign by Roxley Games.</description>
