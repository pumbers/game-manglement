      <title>Star Trek Adventures: Fighters</title>

      <description>The Command Division sourcebook for Star Trek Adventures includes, almost hidden away in the Federation Small Craft chapter, the details of the Federation Attack Fighter, also called the Zabathu1 class (after an Andorian riding animal). This is really the first reference in the rules made to any sort of fighter class ship and, to be sure, such craft are rarely seen in Star Trek itself. Most ship battles on screen are between two or more capital ships which make up the vast majority of any factionâ€™s fleet.</description>

      <description>My love of the Cypher System has been a rocky road (as in rough, not the ice cream). Back when I first laid hands on a copy of Numenera (1st edition), I read it and didn&amp;rsquo;t understand it. I loved the background and storylines - and bear in mind here I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing role-playing games since Classic Traveller at University in England. I still didn&amp;rsquo;t get the game system. My gut told me it worked and it was very good, but my head didn&amp;rsquo;t get it.</description>

      <description>Brass is a board game set in Lancashire, England during the Industrial Revolution, developed by Martin Wallace and originally released in 2007. The object is to use cards and cash to build mines, cotton factories, ports, canals and rail links, and establish trade routes, all of which will be used to victory score points. This review covers the newly-released Lancashire and Birmingham editions from the 2017 Kickstarter campaign by Roxley Games.</description>
