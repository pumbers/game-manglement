      <title>Did Star Wars Really Happen?</title>

      <description>OK, this started as some fun with me messing with my friends heads in a series of Facebook posts while I was rewatching the original Star Wars trilogy, but it grew so out of hand I thought I&amp;rsquo;d expand on it here. To mess with your head.
The Premise It&amp;rsquo;s simple: Star Wars didn&amp;rsquo;t really happen the way it did in the movies. Sure, there was an evil galactic empire that overthrew a good-natured republic and killed off a whole bunch of space-wizards in the process, but that was in the prequel trilogy and I&amp;rsquo;m not going to go there because while they&amp;rsquo;re kinda watchable movies they&amp;rsquo;re also pretty bad as far as the details and canon consistency are concerned, so I&amp;rsquo;m just going to focus on the original trilogy: A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi.</description>

      <description>When it comes to science-fiction roleplaying games, Traveller is granddaddy of them all, and it has it&amp;rsquo;s own setting (the Third Imperium) that&amp;rsquo;s been around from day one. Outside role-playing (but supported by several different games over the years) you have universes such as Star Wars, Star Trek and, more recently, The Expanse. But what other &amp;ldquo;universes&amp;rdquo; are there out there for adventuring, what kinds of stories might they inspire, and what RPG systems suit their particular style of story telling.</description>

      <title>Building Compendia for Foundry VTT</title>

      <description>Creating A Compendium From the official Knowledge Base and the community web site, there are two explanations given on how to create a compendium for Foundry VTT, others are often discussed on the Discord server. The first, and most obvious, is to create it manually within a game world, but this has several limitations: it&amp;rsquo;s slow and time consuming to create and edit once created, and (without some jiggery-pokery) the compendium is bound to that particular world and not easily re-used across several game worlds.</description>

      <description>The Star Trek Adventures: Command Division sourcebook introduced stats for new ships from Star Trek canon, many of which have either never been seen or seen only rarely on-screen. Among them is the Norway Class, which was designed by the Advanced Starship Design Bureau for rapid emergency response. So, what&amp;rsquo;s it like being on the crew of one of these ships, what adventures can you have and how do you handle them?</description>

      <title>Star Trek Adventures: Fighters</title>

      <description>The Command Division sourcebook for Star Trek Adventures includes, almost hidden away in the Federation Small Craft chapter, the details of the Federation Attack Fighter, also called the Zabathu1 class (after an Andorian riding animal). This is really the first reference in the rules made to any sort of fighter class ship and, to be sure, such craft are rarely seen in Star Trek itself. Most ship battles on screen are between two or more capital ships which make up the vast majority of any factionâ€™s fleet.</description>
